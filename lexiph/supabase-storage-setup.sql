-- =====================================================

-- Policy: Users can upload their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own documents"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'documents' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Policy: Users can view their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own documents"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (
  bucket_id = 'documents' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Policy: Users can update their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own documents"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'documents' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Policy: Users can delete their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own documents"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'documents' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- =====================================================
