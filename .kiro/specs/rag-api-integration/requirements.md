# Requirements Document - RAG API Integration

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating the Philippine Legislation Research API (RAG API) into the LexiPH application. The RAG API provides intelligent search and summarization of Philippine legislation, enabling users to query laws, regulations, and compliance requirements through natural language questions. The integration will enhance the compliance chat mode by providing authoritative, context-aware responses backed by actual legislation documents.

## Glossary

- **RAG System**: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that searches legislation documents and generates summaries
- **LexiPH Application**: The main web application for Philippine legal research and compliance
- **Compliance Mode**: A chat mode specifically designed for compliance-related queries
- **API Service Layer**: The TypeScript service that handles communication with the RAG API
- **WebSocket Connection**: A persistent bidirectional connection for real-time streaming updates
- **Health Check**: An API endpoint that verifies the RAG service is operational
- **Search Query**: A generated query used to search the legislation database
- **Summary Response**: A structured markdown summary of legislation findings

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enables real-time updates, THE LexiPH Application SHALL establish a WebSocket Connection to the RAG System
2. WHEN the RAG System generates search queries, THE LexiPH Application SHALL display a progress event indicating query generation status
3. WHEN the RAG System searches the legislation database, THE LexiPH Application SHALL display a progress event indicating search status and document count
4. WHEN the RAG System generates a summary, THE LexiPH Application SHALL display a progress event indicating summarization status
5. WHEN the WebSocket Connection is lost, THE LexiPH Application SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically within 5 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health and availability of the RAG API, so that I can ensure the service is operational and troubleshoot issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE LexiPH Application SHALL provide a Health Check function that queries the RAG System status endpoint
2. WHEN the Health Check is executed, THE LexiPH Application SHALL display the service status within 2 seconds
3. WHEN the RAG System is unavailable, THE LexiPH Application SHALL display an error message indicating the service is down
4. WHEN the RAG System returns an error status, THE LexiPH Application SHALL log the error details for debugging
5. THE LexiPH Application SHALL execute a Health Check automatically when the compliance mode is first accessed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear error messages when my query fails, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the RAG System returns a validation error, THE LexiPH Application SHALL display a user-friendly error message explaining the query requirements
2. WHEN a network error occurs during API communication, THE LexiPH Application SHALL display a message indicating connectivity issues
3. WHEN the RAG System times out after 30 seconds, THE LexiPH Application SHALL display a timeout message and offer to retry
4. WHEN the RAG System returns no results, THE LexiPH Application SHALL display a message suggesting alternative search terms
5. WHEN an error occurs, THE LexiPH Application SHALL provide a retry button that resubmits the original query

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable API service layer with proper TypeScript types, so that I can easily integrate RAG functionality throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API Service Layer SHALL define TypeScript interfaces for all RAG System request and response types
2. THE API Service Layer SHALL provide a function for simple RAG queries that returns a typed response
3. THE API Service Layer SHALL provide a function for Health Check queries that returns a typed response
4. THE API Service Layer SHALL provide a WebSocket class that handles connection lifecycle and message parsing
5. THE API Service Layer SHALL handle all HTTP errors and throw typed exceptions with descriptive messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test sample queries to understand the system's capabilities, so that I can learn how to formulate effective questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE LexiPH Application SHALL provide a list of at least 8 sample queries covering different legislation topics
2. WHEN the user selects a sample query, THE LexiPH Application SHALL populate the query input field with the selected text
3. THE sample queries SHALL include specific law queries, general topic queries, and requirements-based queries
4. THE sample queries SHALL demonstrate proper query formulation for optimal results
5. THE LexiPH Application SHALL allow users to modify sample queries before submission

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see structured, readable summaries of legislation, so that I can quickly understand the key points without reading full legal documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the RAG System returns a summary, THE LexiPH Application SHALL render the markdown-formatted summary with proper styling
2. THE LexiPH Application SHALL display summary sections with clear visual hierarchy using headings and spacing
3. WHEN the summary contains lists or bullet points, THE LexiPH Application SHALL render them with proper indentation
4. WHEN the summary contains legal citations, THE LexiPH Application SHALL display them in a distinguishable format
5. THE LexiPH Application SHALL ensure summary text is readable with sufficient contrast ratios meeting WCAG AA standards

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to respond within a reasonable time, so that I can maintain productivity without long waiting periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a simple query, THE RAG System SHALL return a response within 10 seconds
2. WHEN the user submits a complex query, THE RAG System SHALL return a response within 15 seconds
3. WHEN the Health Check is executed, THE RAG System SHALL respond within 1 second
